# Text Generation with Spelling Hallucinations

This repository contains a [Streamlit](http://www.streamlit.io) app that can be used
to demonstrate some concepts of generative language models.  It generates only a
very tiny subset of the English language, all sentences of the form 
`WORD starts with the letter LETTER.` for various words and letters.
You can customize the sophistication of the (very very simple) model so that
various types of errors (including what LLMs call "hallucinations") are exhibited
or are not exhibited.  It is useful as a demo of some concepts in text generation.
